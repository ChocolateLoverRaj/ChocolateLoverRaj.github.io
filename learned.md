## Things I Learned
These are some programming related things that I learned.

## [code.org](https://www.code.org)

The first programming related thing I learned was at school. In my school, once or twice every year we did a things called [*hour of code*](https://code.org/learn) on code.org. This was when I was in 5k. In code.org, I did things like moving an object up, down, left, and right to get out of a maze. Code.org has drag and drop blocks that you can adjust. Code.org has small coding tutorials that are for teaching little kids some simple coding.

### What I learned
I learned how to make a sequence of tasks that get run. In the maze course, they were blocks called `forward`, `backward`, and `turn` (for turning left and right).

I also learned that tasks can be repeated multiple times. There was a `loop` block, which you can choose how many times it gets run. I learned that things inside the `loop` block get run multiple times, while things outside the `loop` block get run a single time. I also learned about conditionally doing things, such as turning left or right based on whether there is a wall ahead or not.


### Projects I Made
When learning coding on code.org, I did many puzzles where you have to move a character through obstacles, going from a starting point to a destination point.

## [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org)

When I was in 2nd grade, my friend talked about a thing called *javascript*, which he was learning on Khan Academy. I got interested, and I also started doing a course called [*Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation*](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming). The course was a set of videos, challenges, quizzes, and projects. The course was based on drawing and animating shapes with javascript.

### What I learned
I learned what javascript is. I learned the syntax, such as declaring and using variables, and calling functions. At first, the course taught how to call some functions that Khan Academy provided. Example:
``` js
rect(0, 0, 400, 400);
```
This drew a rectangle on the screen, which had a total size of 400 by 400 pixels. The course also taught how to use different types of data, like numbers, strings, objects, and arrays. I learned how to declare variables and change them. An animation looked like this.
``` js
var x = 100;

var draw = function(){
    ellipse(x, 200, 50, 50);

    x += 1;
};
```
Any function named `draw` was called automatically by Khan Academy, which made a circle go from left to right on the screen.
