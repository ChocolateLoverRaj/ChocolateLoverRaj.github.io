### What
The game is about choosing a phrase that is an idiom. There are two different phrases. One of them is an idiom, and one of them is not. There is a kitty that is constantly moving from left to right, and you have to click a button to stop the kitty. If the phrase which is an idiom is on the left side, you have to stop the kitty while it's on the left side. After you stop the kitty, you get to know if you are correct or incorrect and you can continue to the next question.

### Technologies Used
Html, JavaScript

### When
When I was in 6th grade.

### Why
In 6th grade, my teacher assigned everyone to learn about a different literature related topic. My friend and I got idioms. We had to make a project to teach our classmates about our topic. We made a video about idioms and a html game.

### Challenges
- When I was finding images for the kitty, brussels sprouts, and donut, I was confused why the 'link' to the image was gigantic. I didn't know that it wasn't a link, but the entire image data, when I clicked 'copy image address'. This made it hard to edit the code because the `src` took up the whole screen.

### What I learned
- How to change the content of a html element based on a javascript array.
- How to make an image move from left to right.
- How to change the css of an element by setting a class with javascript.
