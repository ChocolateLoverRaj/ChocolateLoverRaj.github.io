## [Banana Games](https://banana-games.herokuapp.com)
A website for playing games.

### Technologies Used
Node.js, Html, JavaScript.

### When
When I was in 7th grade.

### What
I made banana games because I wanted to make a website to play games on. I ended up not making any games, but I made a website with a lot of different features.

#### RESTful API
I made a RESTful API, which the frontend communicates with in a user friendly way.

#### Frontend
Html pages with colorful css. Javascript to process forms and communicate with the server.

#### Signing up / logging in
I made a form for signing up, which has a lot of validation, and icons to show if a field is ok or not. After creating an account, the server sends an email to the email address with that account (this doesn't work because my sendgrid account doesn't work). 

#### Changing account info
I made another form and RESTful api for editing account info, as well as deleting accounts

#### Friends
There is also a feature where you can add friends. There is a tab for friends, people who've you've sent a friend request to, and people who are requesting to be your friend.

#### ~~Games~~
I abandoned banana games when I started making games. This is funny because I spent more work on *every other feature* than the actual *games* part.

### Why
I wanted to make a gaming website.
