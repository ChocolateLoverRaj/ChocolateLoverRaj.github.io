### Technologies Used
JavaScript, Khan Academy Javascript

### When
When I was in 4th grade.

### Why
In 4th grade, there were some special chairs in our classroom. My teacher had wooden popsicle sticks in a can, and there was one stick for every student. She randomly picked from those sticks to see who gets to sit in the special chairs. I made a digital stick picker, which randomly chooses students from a list of names. I made another stick picker for 5th grade, with different students.

### What I Learned
- How to reference an array that I can easily add, remove, and change names in.
- How to pick a random item in an array.
- How to swap two items in an array.
