### Technologies Used
Html, Html Canvas, JavaScript.

### When
When I was in 6th grade.

### Why
It was for a school project. We were learning about the Sun, Earth, and Moon.

### Challenges
- It was hard figuring out how to draw the moon. I had to find out how to find the coordinate in a circle.
- I had to figure out how to draw part of the moon. I ended up using a really inefficient way by drawing many horizontal lines. This makes it run good on fast computers and really slow on slow computers.

### What I learned
- How to calculate the coordinates in a circular path.
- How to use a html canvas and make gradients.
