## [Satisfying Animations](/html/satisfying-animations)
Animated html and SVG.

### Technologies Used
Html, Css, SVG

### When
When I was in 7th grade.

### Why
I wanted to make things that are satisfying to look at. Most of these are looped over and over, and are colorful.

### What

### Html Animations with `position: fixed;`

#### [Flicker](/html/satisfying-animations/flicker.html)
The first thing that I made that is part of this group is just a page that flickers between white and black. View at your own risk.

<details>
    <summary><b style="color: red;">Warning! Flickering screen!</b></summary>
    <iframe src="/html/satisfying-animations/flicker.html"></iframe>
</details>

#### [Grow](/html/satisfying-animations/grow.html)
Rainbow rectangles that group bigger and bigger.

<iframe src="/html/satisfying-animations/grow.html"></iframe>

#### [Magnify](/html/satisfying-animations/magnify.html)
Concentric black and white circles. It's called magnify because if you look away after staring at it things appear magnified.

<iframe src="/html/satisfying-animations/magnify.html"></iframe>

#### [Rainbow](/html/satisfying-animations/rainbow.html)
Page with colorful background animated with Css.

<iframe src="/html/satisfying-animations/rainbow.html"></iframe>

#### [Shift](/html/satisfying-animations/shift.html)
Rectangles that move back and forth clockwise while changing colors.

<iframe src="/html/satisfying-animations/shift.html"></iframe>

#### [Shrink](/html/satisfying-animations/shrink.html)
Like [magnify](#magnify), but if you look away things shrink.

<iframe src="/html/satisfying-animations/shrink.html"></iframe>

#### [Spiral](/html/satisfying-animations/spiral.html)
Similar to [shift](#shift), except this time the colors don't change and the colors move clockwise without moving back.

<iframe src="/html/satisfying-animations/spiral.html"></iframe>

#### [Squish](/html/satisfying-animations/squish.html)
My favorite animation, which is supposed to look like a busy station of an assembly line. Because of scaling problems with this `<iframe>`, please click on the link above if you want to see the actual page.

### SVG Animations

#### [Dodger](/html/satisfying-animations/dodger.svg)
At first I was trying to make a Moon orbiting an Earth orbiting a Sun, but then I discovered that when the moon orbits at the same speed as the Earth in the opposite directions, it looks like the moon is just barely avoiding being hit by the Earth.

<iframe src="/html/satisfying-animations/dodger.svg"></iframe>

#### [Bread](/html/satisfying-animations/bread.svg)
Rotating bread.

<iframe id="satisfying-bread" src="/html/satisfying-animations/bread.svg"></iframe>
<button onclick="javascript:document.getElementById('satisfying-bread').src += '';">Reload Iframe</button>

#### [Lines](/html/satisfying-animations/lines.svg)
Colorful lines that are overlapping in a pattern. Based on something that I drew on paper.

<iframe src="/html/satisfying-animations/lines.svg"></iframe>

#### [Pencil](/html/satisfying-animations/pencil.svg)
A pencil falling forever.

<iframe src="/html/satisfying-animations/pencil.svg"></iframe>

#### [Satisfying](/html/satisfying-animations/satisfying.svg)
Bars that move perfectly so that the balls can pass.

<iframe id="satisfying-iframe" src="/html/satisfying-animations/satisfying.svg"></iframe>
<button onclick="javascript:document.getElementById('satisfying-iframe').src += '';">Reload Iframe</button>

#### [Test](/html/satisfying-animations/test.svg)
A circle that changes colors as it moves from left to right. This was the first thing I made to try out SVG animations.

<iframe src="/html/satisfying-animations/test.svg"></iframe>

### What I learned
- `<div>`s aren't just for grouping elements.
- SVG can be animated.
