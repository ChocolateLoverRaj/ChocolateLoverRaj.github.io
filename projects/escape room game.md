### Technologies Used
Html, Html Canvas, JavaScript

### When
When I was in 6th grade.

### Why
At the end of the year, our class made an escape room. We all made an activity for visitors to do as part of the escape room. The theme of the escape room was stopping a robber from stealing diamonds. My activity was this game. To make the escape room harder, people who played our escape room had to get a 6 digit code from another challenge before being able to do my activity.

### What I learned
- How to use Local Storage and Session Storage.
- How to play music on an html page.
- How to go to a different page using `window.location.replace()`.
- How to use `prompt()`.
- How to draw external images onto a `canvas`.
